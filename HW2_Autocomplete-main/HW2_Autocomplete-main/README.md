The name of your buddy, if you chose to work with one.
- mike and I worked together on this 
Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (I will not judge you for this at all...I am simply using it to gauge if the assignments are too easy or hard)
it took around 4-6 hours, with the proofs
Your overall impression of the assignment. Did you love it, hate it, or were you neutral? One word answers are fine, but if you have any suggestions for the future let me know.
-it was interesting and not so challenging that I hated working on it, and the logical side of the proofs allowed different strengths to come out of people
Any other concerns that you have. For instance, if you have a bug that you were unable to solve but you made progress, write that here. The more you articulate the problem the more partial credit you will receive (fine to leave this blank)
I am honestly proud and confident in my work this time!
