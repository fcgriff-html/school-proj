The name of your buddy, if you chose to work with one.
    I did not work with a buddy
Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (I will not judge you for this at all...I am simply using it to gauge if the assignments are too easy or hard)
    it took me 4 to 5 hours over the course of 4 days
Your overall impression of the assignment. Did you love it, hate it, or were you neutral? One word answers are fine, but if you have any suggestions for the future let me know.
    I like it, it is still conceptually rough and I know I did not implement it properly, and for that I am very sorry
Any other concerns that you have. For instance, if you have a bug that you were unable to solve but you made progress, write that here. The more you articulate the problem the more partial credit you will receive (fine to leave this blank)
    I appreciate all your help, I got the time plot, I think. I am sorry I couldnt get it completely good. I will continue to work on it but I need to submit it today before work so that I do not miss the extension window. sorry again.  I will ask some more questions on discord. Thank you again, and sorry
