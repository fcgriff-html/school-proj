A title for your musical statement
 - i will call it late_night
If you want to submit your musical statement to the music contest, and if so, what name or pseudonym you would like to use in the musical gallery on our class web site
- i dont think it is particularly good so i wont be submitting it, thank you though
Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (I will not judge you for this at all...I am simply using it to gauge if the assignments are too easy or hard)
- the final stretch took about 15 hours (all in 1 day, with an hour and a half break), and until that point it probably took about 6 hrs, for a total of 21
Your overall impression of the assignment. Did you love it, hate it, or were you neutral? One word answers are fine, but if you have any suggestions for the future let me know.
- I thought it was fun, i wish i was more math-minded to think of some of the transformations first, prior to playing around in other ways.
Any other concerns that you have. For instance, if you have a bug that you were unable to solve but you made progress, write that here. The more you articulate the problem the more partial credit you will receive (fine to leave this blank)
- still couldnt get brass to make noise and coudldnt figure out why, that was the biggest headache of the back 4 hours. Also I worked partially with Mike, and Alexa, and Alexa and I jumped in the HW collab channel with Tom B and CJ last night to try and help them.
