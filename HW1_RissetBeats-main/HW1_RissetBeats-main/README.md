# HW1_RissetBeats
1.	A title for your musical statement
1.	My title is morning waves, just sounded like a nokia ring tone, and thought it would be nice
2.	If you want to submit your musical statement to the music contest, and if so, what name or pseudonym you would like to use in the musical gallery on our class web site
1.	I do not wish to submit my song
3.	Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (I will not judge you for this at all...I am simply using it to gauge if the assignments are too easy or hard)
1.	This took like 5-8 hours over the course of 3 or 4 days, I worked with griffin, joe, alexa, and Liz to figure out part 2 (I was initially going in a completely different direction but they helped reign me in lol), but part 1 was just me and my questions to you
4.	Your overall impression of the assignment. Did you love it, hate it, or were you neutral? One word answers are fine, but if you have any suggestions for the future let me know.
1.	I think it was a cool assignment, I listen to a lot of video game OSTs and it reminded me of them a lot
5.	Any other concerns that you have. For instance, if you have a bug that you were unable to solve but you made progress, write that here. The more you articulate the problem the more partial credit you will receive (fine to leave this blank)
1.	I think my part two doubles back and plays the tune in reverse underneath the initial tune, not sure why, but any other variation of the zip loop I tried ended up giving me beats and no note changes.
